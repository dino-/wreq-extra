# wreq-extra


## Synopsis

Exploring non-throwing get and post calls with wreq


## Description

Exploring how wreq handles non-2XX codes and working out how to NOT throw an IO
exception when this occurs. This could also be used as a library in this form
where clients import getAny and postAny from Network.Wreq.Extra


## Getting source

Source code is available from github at the [wreq-extra](https://github.com/dino-/wreq-extra) project page.
